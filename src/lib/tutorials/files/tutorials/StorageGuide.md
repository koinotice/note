# Storage guide
Storages and folders can help you to organize your notes. Check this guide and start organizing to make your life easier!

## Adding a Storage
One of the first thing you want to do in order to use Boostnote is to create a storage. In order to do so, you can click on the link in the sidebar.

## Storage Can Have Folders
Each storage can have as many folders as you want, and you can create even subfolders inside there.

You can check the Sample Storage on the sidebar and play around with it so you can get some ideas on how you want to organize with this feature!

## Local Storage & Cloud Storage
This feature has two storage types, local and cloud. There are no limitations for local storage number (like older version Boostnote), but if you want to create more than two cloud storage, you need to upgrade your plan to do so. [Follow this link](https://boostnote.io/) to upgrade the plan :)

## Sync Your Cloud Storage
The merit of cloud storage is syncing your notes on every platform. Even when you are offline, Boostnote will start syncing once it became online.

If there is something problem and couldn't sync your notes, this app will tell you how to solve it.
